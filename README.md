# Knowledge-Mining-from-Large-Models

This repository provides the open-source code for the paper *"Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Knowledge Mining from Large Models."* It includes the complete implementation necessary to replicate the results presented in the study.

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Prepare the Data:**
   Unzip the `data/Kvasir-SEG.zip` file to extract the dataset.

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Navigate to the Jupyter notebook `src/Unet-Kvasir-SEG.ipynb` for the main implementation of our method.
   - This notebook includes code for both the proposed method and baseline methods, which utilize point and bounding box prompts with a 50% train split.

Feel free to explore and modify the code as needed for your research and development.
